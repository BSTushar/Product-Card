# Product Card Project

## Project Description

This project is a simple and visually appealing **Product Card** for a coffee mug, created using HTML and CSS. It demonstrates the use of flexbox, styling, and layout alignment to present a product in a neat, card-like format. This card includes an image, description, price details, and an "Add to Cart" button.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The card is centered on the page, responsive for screens, and uses flexbox for layout.
- **Product Details:** Contains product image, name, description, and pricing (with original price and discount price).
- **Interactive Button:** The "Add to Cart" button has a hover effect for enhanced user experience.
- **Clean UI**: The card has a minimalist design with a background shadow to emphasize the content.
